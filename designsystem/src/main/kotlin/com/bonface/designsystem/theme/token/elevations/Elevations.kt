 * Defines a semantic set of elevation values used across the applicationâ€™s UI.

 *
 * @property none   Zero elevation, typically used for flat surfaces.
 * @property xSmall Extra small elevation, used for subtle surface separation.
 * @property small  Small elevation, often applied to lightweight components.
 * @property medium Medium elevation, commonly used for cards or floating elements.
 * @property large  Large elevation, used for emphasized surfaces.
 * @property xLarge Extra large elevation, applied to highly prominent elements.
 * @property max    Maximum elevation, reserved for top-level surfaces such as dialogs.
